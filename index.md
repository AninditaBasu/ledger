# Ledger Theme for GitHub Pages

---

`ledger` is a minimal documentation theme inspired by parchment manuscripts, designed for clarity, readability, and zero-setup deployment on GitHub Pages.

See it in action here:

- [Default (light)]({{ '/examples/light.html' | relative_url }}), for the default (light) look. Light tan with brown ink.
- [Dark]({{ '/examples/dark.html' | relative_url }}), for a darker, palmleaf look. Muted green with plant-ink brown text.
